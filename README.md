## What is it?

Using Cloudflare Workers, this is an application that randomly sends users to one of two given webpages. Throughout the project, I have gained further experience in writing applications with the Cloudflare Workers API, using Wrangler, and deploying an application to the workers.dev playground.


## To Do

- [X] Install the workers command-line tool wrangler
- [x] Generate a new project using `wrangler generate` command
- [x] Use `wrangler dev` to locally test/develop your application
- [x] Request the URLs from the API
- [x] Request a variant
- [x] Distribute requests between variants
- [x] Register a workers.dev subdomain
- [x] User should be able to visit the deployed version of the site
- [x] *Extra Credit* -  Change/copy URLS
- [x] *Extra Credit* - Add cookies
- [x] Update README
- [x] Submit project
